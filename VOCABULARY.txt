The fundamental concept of mum is the TURN, representing a region of
space-time.

Each TURN involves one or more PLAYERs (characters controlled by
humans or AI) in exactly one ARENA.

During the TURN each PLAYER takes one ACTION (slowed players might be
forced to take a specific action on turns that they can't move in?).
After all players have chosen their action, effects happen and the
TURN is considered DONE and another turn begins.

Each PLAYER and ARENA is associated with one TURN that is not DONE at
any given time.  PLAYERs have access to completed TURNs that the
client hasn't seen yet, but they can't be modified.
